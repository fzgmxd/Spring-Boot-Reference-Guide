### 58.4.1 AWS Elastic Beanstalk

As described in the official Elastic Beanstalk Java guide, there are two main options to deploy a Java application; You can either use the “Tomcat Platform” or the “Java SE platform”.

Using the Tomcat platform

This option applies to Spring Boot projects producing a war file. There is no any special configuration required, just follow the official guide.

Using the Java SE platform

This option applies to Spring Boot projects producing a jar file and running an embedded web container. Elastic Beanstalk environments run an nginx instance on port 80 to proxy the actual application, running on port 5000. To configure it, add the following to your application.properties:

server.port=5000
Best practices

Uploading binaries instead of sources

By default Elastic Beanstalk uploads sources and compile them in AWS. To upload the binaries instead, add the following to your .elasticbeanstalk/config.yml file:

deploy:
    artifact: target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Reduce costs by setting the environment type

By default an Elastic Beanstalk environment is load balanced. The load balancer has a cost perspective, to avoid it, set the environment type to “Single instance” as described in the Amazon documentation. Single instance environments can be created using the CLI as well using the following command:

eb create -s
